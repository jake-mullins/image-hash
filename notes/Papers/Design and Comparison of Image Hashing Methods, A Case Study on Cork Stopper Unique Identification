Using image hashing of corks for anti-counterfeiting efforts in Portugal
Analyzing image HASHES instead of actual images speeds up problem by about ~40 times allegedly
This kind of analysis can be applied to counterfeit medicine

Fingerprint of Things
    - Non-invasive
    - Inexpensive compared to shipping everything with RFID tags
    - Basically just photographing stuff as it comes off of the assembly line

Physical Unclonability and Disorder (PUD)
    - Randomness/distribution of physical characteristics
    - UNique Objects (UNOs)
        - Scratches on the face of a screw
        - Time skew on a quartz clock
    - Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs)

Using a hash for image analysis has a couple of advantages
    - Reduction in noise
    - Faster to compute

Image rotation is the toughest problem to solve
Interpolation when scaling to 512x512 is done using bicubic interpolation of its neighbors

Gaussian smoothing to get rid of noise
Cropping
    - Because this was done on the business end of a cork, they got away with a circle cropping
Contrast stretching
    - If a low contrast image, normalizes to use the full range of [0-255]
    
Discrete Cosine Transform DCT
    Look up DCT table, basically a way of seeing how much any of those cells contribute to the image
Discrete Wavelet Transform DWT
    Like DCT but better for high frequency inputs using 
Difference Hash DH
    DHash in that original blog post. Reduces picture down to NxN grayscale, changes all resulting pixels to 0 or 1 based on a threshold, and a row/column hash is calculated based on if it increases
Average Hash AH
    AHash in the original blog post. Reduces picture to NxN grayscale, averages intensity of all pixels, each pixel is compared to the average value.
Radon Transform RT
    I DONT UNDERSTAND not super relevant so I'm not too worked up 
Hough Transform
    I DONT UNDERSTAND not super relevant so I'm not too worked up
    Allegedly good at finding straight lines in the presence of noise
