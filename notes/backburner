Would layered perlin noise be a good route? Like from Sebastian Lague?
    Random colors
    Random strengths of octaves
    Random frequencies of octaves
    
Blurhash, Great product, interesting, but not relevant

Opensource C++ Perlin and more noise library

Couldn't add together a bunch of sine waves to randomly create a signal that that is resistant to being calculated the other way, as you could simply do a fourier transform to get the inputs. What are some ways around this? Maybe for each sample, a random offset that is recorded in a private place?

Can I check for "similarity" using whatever sentiment analysis thing that can check similarity

For vscode, tasks.json holds compilation information, launch.json holds command line arguments

If undefined reference to a libnoise thing, make sure you're using  ''g++ source_filename -o output_name -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lnoise''
