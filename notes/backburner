Anything with an X has been investigated enough
Anything with a Y is an answer to the previous question 
This is for CONCEPTS, NOT a todo list. Anything that needs to be DONE on the code will be in comments

X Look into gravatar.com
Y Cool product, not useful

X Would layered perlin noise be a good route? Like from Sebastian Lague?
    Random colors
    Random strengths of octaves
    Random frequencies of octaves
Y Seems good enough. 

X Blurhash, Great product, interesting, but not relevant

X Opensource C++ Perlin and more noise library
X http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/
Y I hate old code but honestly new c++ code is not much better. Does exactly what I want and has a lot of handles you can turn. More importantly, you can string generator modules together to add more complexity

X For vscode, tasks.json holds compilation information, launch.json holds command line arguments

Couldn't add together a bunch of sine waves to randomly create a signal that that is resistant to being calculated the other way, as you could simply do a fourier transform to get the inputs. What are some ways around this? Maybe for each sample, a random offset that is recorded in a private place?
CAN YOU FOURIER TRANSFORM YAHSELF A SYSTEM OF ANY PERIODIC FUNCTIONS? CAN YOU DO THE SAME IF EVERY INPUT HAS A RANDOM OFFSET? Like
    y = 5sin(2x) + 1
    y = 4tan(0.15x) - 4 

Can I check for "similarity" using whatever sentiment analysis thing that can check similarity

If undefined reference to a libnoise thing, make sure you're using  ''g++ source_filename -o output_name -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lnoise''
