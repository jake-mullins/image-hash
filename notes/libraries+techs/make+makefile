Executed with make command

File format is 
function_name:
    command1 arg1 arg2
    command2 arg3 arg4

Docs say
target: prereqs
    recipe

say_hello:
    @echo "Hello World" 
    @ symbol surpresses echo "Hello World"

By default only runs first target/function
Can override this with
.DEFAULT_GOAL := generate
